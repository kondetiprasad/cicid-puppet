##### active checks related
### option: serveractive
#       list of comma delimited ip:port (or hostname:port) pairs of zabbix servers for active checks.
#       if port is not specified, default port is used.
#       ipv6 addresses must be enclosed in square brackets if port for that host is specified.
#       if port is not specified, square brackets for ipv6 addresses are optional.
#       if this parameter is not specified, active checks are disabled.

#	if not defined, value will be acquired from hostmetadataitem.
#

### option: hostmetadataitem
#	optional parameter that defines an item used for getting host metadata.
#	host metadata is used at host auto-registration process.
#	during an auto-registration request an agent will log a warning message if

### option: maxlinespersecond
#       maximum number of new lines the agent will send per second to zabbix server
#       or proxy processing 'log' and 'logrt' active checks.
#       the provided value will be overridden by the parameter 'maxlines',
#       provided in 'log' or 'logrt' item keys.
#
MaxLinesPerSecond=100

############ advanced parameters #################

### option: alias
#       sets an alias for parameter. it can be useful to substitute long and complex parameter name with a smaller and simpler one.
#

### option: timeout
#       spend no more than timeout seconds on processing
#
Timeout=3

### option: allowroot
#       allow the agent to run as 'root'. if disabled and the agent is started by 'root', the agent

#       1 - allow
#
AllowRoot=0

### option: include
#       you may include individual files or all files in a directory in the configuration file.
